> **RemoKey** turns a Xiaomi Bluetooth Remote 2 Pro into a full macOS controller. Hold the
> voice key and talk — your speech is typed into the focused field via a private ATVV audio
> channel and an IME. The 13 physical keys map to keystrokes, window switching, tab jumping,
> a mouse mode, per-app profiles, and an "approve/reject" layer for AI coding agents. Native
> Swift 6, zero third-party dependencies.

## Why this exists

A remote you can use lying on the couch to drive an AI agent in your terminal: talk to write
code, use the D-pad to scroll results, one key to approve/reject the agent's changes. This
Xiaomi remote is cheap, feels great, and has a microphone. Over Bluetooth, its keys and voice
are two independent channels — perfect for a Mac to fully take over.

## Features

- **Voice input** — hold the voice key and talk to the remote; text lands in the focused
  field. It flows through the remote's built-in mic → ATVV private GATT → IMA ADPCM decode →
  BlackHole virtual audio device → Doubao IME, all automatically.
- **13 keys × multiple triggers** — every key supports tap / hold / double / layer / gesture
  (OK + direction), squeezing dozens of action slots out of one remote. The default config
  has **zero chord combos** (fully serialized, one-thumb operation); simultaneous-press
  gestures remain available for power users to configure.
- **App control mode** — the TV key enters a per-app advanced layer with a HUD hint;
  direction / OK / back / volume ± then run that app's dedicated actions inside the mode.
- **AI approval layer** — in terminal apps, OK = approve, back = reject, volume ± = switch
  agent, menu = Shift+Tab; tailored to AI coding agents' confirmation flow.
- **Window switcher** — the menu key pops an overlay; left/right selects a window, up/down
  widens the scope (current app → all apps), OK confirms, back closes.
- **Self-healing health checks** — `--doctor` diagnoses and fixes common issues with
  permissions, BlackHole, and leftover key mappings in one shot.
- **Configuration import** — preview profile replacement counts before importing JSON; undo the latest import during the current run, until another configuration save succeeds.
- **Preset library** — built-in profiles for Ghostty / WeChat / browsers / video players,
  with an overlay-inheritance model, one-click import, and JSON export for sharing.
- **Zero dependencies** — all native frameworks (CoreBluetooth / IOKit / CoreGraphics /
  AVFoundation / SwiftUI); no third-party packages.

## Supported apps and tools

“Built-in preset” means RemoKey ships ready-to-use bindings for that app. “Generic integration” means RemoKey provides the control or audio path, while you choose a shortcut or microphone in the target app. Other top-level macOS apps can be added from the running-app list and mapped manually.

### Built-in app presets

| Category | App | Bundle ID | Main bindings |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AI / terminal | Ghostty | `com.mitchellh.ghostty` | Codex / Claude Code selection, confirm, interrupt, clear line, and tab switching |
| AI desktop | Codex | `com.openai.codex` | Task tabs, selection, confirm, back, and focus input |
| AI desktop | ChatGPT | `com.openai.chat` | Send, stop generation, search / history, and focus input |
| AI desktop | Claude | `com.anthropic.claudefordesktop` | Tab switching, selection, confirm, back, and focus input |
| Browser | Google Chrome | `com.google.Chrome` | Tab switching, paging, back, address bar, and search |
| Browser | Safari | `com.apple.Safari` | Tab switching, paging, back, address bar, and search |
| Messaging | WeChat | `com.tencent.xinWeChat` | Conversation navigation, send, next unread, and search; File Transfer macro needs device validation |
| Messaging / meeting | Feishu | `com.electron.lark` | `⌘+Enter` send, search, and tabs; meeting mute shortcut needs device validation |
| Video | IINA | `com.colliderli.iina` | Play / pause, seek, full screen, and subtitles |
| Video | VLC | `org.videolan.vlc` | Play / pause, seek, full screen, and subtitle track |
| Presentation | Keynote | `com.apple.iWork.Keynote` | Previous / next slide, start presentation, and black screen |
| Presentation | Microsoft PowerPoint | `com.microsoft.Powerpoint` | Previous / next slide, start presentation, and black screen |
| Meeting | Zoom | `us.zoom.xos` | Microphone mute / unmute and camera toggle |
| Meeting | Tencent Meeting | `com.tencent.meeting` | Microphone mute; confirm the shortcut against the installed app version |

Web content such as YouTube uses the Chrome or Safari preset. RemoKey does not currently switch profiles by website.

### Generic AI and voice integrations

| Type | Supported tools / scenarios | Integration |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AI CLI | Codex CLI, Claude Code, Gemini CLI, aider, opencode | App control mode provides option navigation, confirm, reject / interrupt, automatic-mode switching, and tab switching in terminals such as Ghostty, Terminal, and iTerm2 |
| Standalone voice app | NetEase Bageshuo | Standalone voice-app mode sends the configured trigger and routes remote audio through BlackHole without switching input methods |
| Input-method voice | Doubao Input Method | RemoKey can switch to Doubao when voice starts and send its trigger key |
| Custom-microphone voice tools | Typeless, superwhisper, and other tools that accept a microphone or voice shortcut | Select BlackHole in the tool, or let it follow the system default input; configure the trigger per app |

The running-app picker accepts regular window apps and top-level menu-bar / accessory apps while excluding internal WebKit, GPU, and Networking helpers. Generic integration does not mean every third-party release has been validated on hardware; use the shortcut settings provided by the installed app version when they differ.

```

On the BLE link, keys and voice are two non-interfering channels: keys go over standard HID,
remapped at the device level with `hidutil` to a side-effect-free relay key, then captured and
parsed by a `CGEventTap`; voice goes over the ATVV private GATT service, connected directly by
CoreBluetooth without the system taking it over. See [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) (Chinese).

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. Build (Command Line Tools only, no full Xcode needed)
./build.sh
.build/miremote --self-test      # the built-in self-test should be all green

# 2. Build an Apple Development-signed local package
./scripts/setup-signing.sh       # verify the team's Apple Development identity
./scripts/package.sh             # output name includes -development

# 3. First launch: the wizard walks you through Bluetooth / Input Monitoring / Accessibility
```

> Use `./build.sh` (direct `swiftc`) rather than `swift build`: CLT ships without XCTest, so
> tests are compiled into the binary and run via `--self-test`. To preview just the GUI, use
> `.build/miremote --ui-preview`.

## Key cheat sheet

| Key | Tap | Hold |
|---|---|---|
| D-pad ↑↓←→ | Move cursor | Continuous move |
| OK | Return | — (customizable; some app presets = Ctrl+C, etc.) |
| Back | Delete / close overlay | — |
| Home | Show desktop | Mapping tutorial overlay for current app |
| Menu | Window switcher overlay | Full system function-menu overlay |
| TV | Enter/exit App control mode | App wheel (release after popping; direction to pick an app, OK / press TV again to confirm, back to cancel, auto-closes in 3s) |
| Volume ± | Volume (inside control mode = prev/next) | Continuous adjust |
| Voice | Hold to talk → text | — |
| Power | Display sleep | Toggle mouse mode (D-pad moves pointer, OK = click) |

**Lost? Hold the menu key for 1.5s = escape hatch**: no matter which layer you're in or which
overlay is open, it force-clears all layers, exits App control mode, and closes every overlay,
returning to the base state (hardcoded fallback, unaffected by config).

Layer-active / mouse-mode / voice-recording — all three hidden states are shown in sync via the
menu-bar icon color and an on-screen corner badge. The double-tap window defaults to 250ms and
only applies to keys with a configured double-tap action (e.g. the TV key in the Zoom preset);
all other keys respond to a short press with zero delay. Full trigger model and default config
are in [DESIGN.md §3](DESIGN.md) (Chinese).

## FAQ

**Keys stopped working after an upgrade?** Official releases keep a stable bundle identifier and
Developer ID identity, but macOS can still require permission repair after an identity change or
a previous preview build. In System Settings → Privacy & Security → Input Monitoring /
Accessibility, remove RemoKey and add it again, then quit and relaunch. Key settings are stored
separately and are preserved.

**Why does voice need BlackHole?** The remote mic's audio is first decoded to PCM, which needs a
virtual audio device to feed the IME as a microphone. After installing
[BlackHole 2ch](https://existential.audio/blackhole/) (free), set the microphone to BlackHole 2ch
in the Doubao IME. It is not set as the system default device and does not affect normal calls.

**Remote/keyboard keys misbehaving after quitting?** RemoKey clears the `hidutil` relay mapping
on quit; if an abnormal exit leaves it behind, run
`hidutil property --set '{"UserKeyMapping":[]}'` in a terminal to restore.

**D-pad drops characters during Secure Input?** Known limitation: during password entry (Secure
Event Input) the system bypasses `CGEventTap` but the `hidutil` mapping still applies, so the
remote's D-pad may leak the relay key into the foreground (a real keyboard is unaffected). v1
accepts this limitation.

## Install (distribution build)

If someone hands you a `.dmg` or `.zip`:

1. Open the DMG and drag `RemoKey.app` into Applications; or unzip and drag it in.
2. A formal release signed with Apple Developer ID and notarized can be launched normally. Older
   preview packages may still be blocked. If Gatekeeper cannot verify a formal release, do not
   bypass the warning; download it from Releases again.
3. Grant the three permissions in the wizard — Bluetooth / Input Monitoring / Accessibility. If a
   change doesn't take effect, quit and relaunch once (note: clicking the red window button only
   closes the window, not the app — choose Quit from the menu-bar icon, then relaunch).
4. An upgrade with the same bundle identifier and Developer ID should retain its identity. If a
   permission is not retained, use the repair steps in the FAQ above.
5. Remote won't connect: hold **Home + Back for 3s** until the indicator blinks to enter pairing,
   then connect it in System Bluetooth; don't run Xiaomi's official "Remote Assistant" at the same
   time (it grabs the device).

Voice typing additionally needs BlackHole 2ch and the Doubao IME; see the FAQ above.

The first upgrade from `MiRemote` to `RemoKey` uses a new bundle identifier, so macOS treats it as
a new app and asks for Bluetooth, Input Monitoring, and Accessibility again. RemoKey migrates the
old app preferences; configuration and statistics remain in the compatibility directory
`~/Library/Application Support/MiRemote/` and are not discarded by the rename.

<!-- Homebrew tap (planned for v2):
brew install --cask godarrenw/tap/miremote -->

## Roadmap

This is the v0.1.0 public preview; the core voice pipeline and key engine are proven on real
hardware. What's next:

- **Homebrew cask distribution** — one-line `brew install --cask`, no more right-click-to-open.
- **Release automation** — move the local Developer ID and notarization flow into protected CI
  after certificate and Notary credentials are configured securely.
- **Key self-learning** — a "press a key to identify it" flow in the UI so the usage table adapts
  to different firmware from measured reports.
- **More built-in presets** — profiles for video / meetings / reading, open to community PRs.
- **Robustness polish** — narrow known limitations like the Secure-Input D-pad leak, expand
  fault-injection coverage.

Full milestones and design trade-offs are in [DESIGN.md §9](DESIGN.md) and
[TESTPLAN.md](TESTPLAN.md) (Chinese).
